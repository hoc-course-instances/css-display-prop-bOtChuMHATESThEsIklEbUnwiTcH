      <h3>blok</h3>
      Block-level elements always start on a new line and take
          up the full width available (stretching left to right
          as far as possible)
      <section class= "blok">BLOCK</section>
      <section class= "blok">BLOCK</section>
      Examples include div, nav, header,
          section, footer, and ul elements.

      <h3>Inline</h3>
      Inline elements do not start on a new line and
          only  occupy the space that their content requires.
          <section class= "box">INLINE</section>. Some examples of inline elemetns include
          span, input, label, select and a.

      <h3>inline-block</h3>
      Inline-block is set by the CSS display property
          and differs to inline elements as we can set
          width and height. We cannot do this width
          inline elemetns as they only take the space their
          content needs. Also, top and bottom margins
          and paddings are respected, but inline elements
          they are not.
          <section class="copper">INLINE-BLOCK</section> <section class="copper">INLINE-BLOCK</section>. Unlike block-level elements,
          inline-block elements do not start on a new
          line and will sit next to other elements.
